<div class="poem">
<h2>The Anatomy of Staying</h2>
<p>
The memory returns in sudden golden light,  
A mercy that the present cannot keep.  
The night reveals what once felt truly right,  
Then teaches how the beautiful can weep.  

I trace my hand, a map of living skin,  
A body trained to breathe and still endure.  
Each pulse repeats a cycle locked within,  
A mechanism fragile, cold, unsure.  

The rain performs its ritual outside,  
Cleans streets but strips my final fragile mask.  
An empty chair still waits by habit’s side,  
For someone time has cancelled from its task.  

Hope dreams of rest where effort finally ends,  
But grief has claimed the air I must still breathe.  
I stay alive where silence never bends,  
Learning the shape of all I cannot leave.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Ultimate Fracture</h2>
<p>
My hands still work from habits long rehearsed,  
They clean the rooms where you no longer stay.  
Each motion feels like breath that’s tightly cursed,  
A silent choke that words refuse to say.  

I scan the news to feel the world still loud,  
To anchor thought in something sharp and real.  
But reason breaks beneath a mental shroud,  
Ignoring signs the end is growing near.  

I drink the water, cold and stripped of taste,  
A simple act that keeps the body whole.  
The spirit lies like wreckage laid to waste,  
A sunken thing beneath the frozen soul.  

The sunrise mocks the promise of repair,  
A painted lie that cannot grant me peace.  
The final wall has fallen everywhere,  
And hope collapses where the dawn should cease.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Reckoning of Annihilation</h2>
<p>
Only a shadow stands where my heart once stayed,  
A scorched reflection in a broken glass.  
Even the candle’s light has learned to fade,  
Surrendering its soul as moments pass.  

I beg the walls to echo something lost,  
A sound that once denied the inner night.  
They answer back with silence, weight, and cost,  
Revealing how the void has gained its might.  

I count each breath like debt I cannot flee,  
A covenant I wish I could erase.  
Each dawn repeats another loss in me,  
A slow collapse time will not interlace.  

This moving body is no longer mine,  
A frame that walks with purpose long erased.  
I stand where something sacred crossed the line,  
Awaiting You — the end time never faced.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Undone Equation</h2>
<p>
My name is spoken loud in empty halls,  
A sound that once confirmed my place to be.  
Now strangers pass, their echoes through these walls,  
A vacant sign of time’s cruel decree.  

Cold concrete presses gently on my feet,  
The floor where living meets the fully dead.  
I close my eyes, seeking a dark retreat,  
Yet darkness holds the memory I dread.  

I search for pain, a proof that I exist,  
But all I feel is neutral, stripped of heat.  
The world expects a turn, a final twist,  
A closure I cannot make complete.  

I am the text forgotten from the age,  
A shadow of the night, a silent stage.  
No act remains, no chapter left to show,  
Just endless dark, the void I now must know.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Geometry of Perpetual End</h2>
<p>
The clock upon the mantel ticks with perfect sound,  
Each second strikes upon the hollow, frozen floor.  
The year moves on, the leaves and sky turn round,  
Yet I remain where all things die once more.  

The scent of pine and cinnamon drifts past,  
A trick to bind the self within the dead.  
I try to hold the joy that cannot last,  
But memory locks the night inside my head.  

The sun will rise and promise nothing new,  
The phantom hours stretch endlessly ahead.  
I trace the shape of light that never grew,  
A fragile hope that fades where shadows tread.  

The balance struck, the final tally done,  
The earthquake silenced, stone rests cold and still.  
I wait for nothing under a dying sun,  
A witness to the void, the emptiness I fill.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Metaphysics of Nothing</h2>
<p>
I watch my wrist move slowly, turning, small,  
A simple machine obeying laws of need.  
The observer sees no knowledge left at all,  
A ghost that’s lost the final shape of creed.  

Books remain unopened, arguments stand still,  
The wisdom of the ages holds no clue.  
The pages blanked by walls of iron will,  
The intellect itself forgets what’s true.  

I pace the room, seeking some ordered space,  
Where chaos bends and every compass stays.  
But nothing guides the heart or time’s embrace,  
The moments stretch, expanding hollow ways.  

The heart dissolves, the past reduced to dust,  
A relic faint, the meaning thrown away.  
I am the proof that nothing can be just,  
The die remains uncast, the night holds sway.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Tyranny of Remembrance</h2>
<p>
Beneath the sun I sit, a frozen, silent hour,  
Its warmth reminds me all that you’ve undone.  
Every ray shines sharp, exposing every scar,  
The empty air betrays the shadow of my run.  

I keep my hands and mind busy with small tasks,  
Yet every motion shows the future I’ve lost.  
Photographs smile clear, locked in their frozen past,  
Each one a weapon wielded at a private cost.  

I look for clouds to soften the relentless light,  
A distant shape I hope might ease my pain.  
But all I see is the wound I cannot hide,  
The proof that every word I said was vain.  

No sorrow left to mine, no feeling left to glean,  
The past now sealed, a perfect, sterile art.  
I worship memory’s cruel, unyielding sheen,  
A tyrant that rules the chambers of my heart.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Undeniable Artifact</h2>
<p>
I dress, I tie the laces, move through practiced ways,  
Yet mirrors show a figure trapped in endless night.  
A stone monument to all my yesterdays,  
A shadow cast where once there was light.  

I force a smile for neighbors, hollow, taught,  
Their eyes perceive the absence on my face.  
A subtraction permanent, cruelly wrought,  
A void that time itself cannot replace.  

The rain falls gently on the world outside,  
Washing all the fleeting stains away.  
Yet inside, decay and emptiness abide,  
A waterless well where grief will stay.  

I open palms to touch what once I knew,  
But nerves recall the ache that cuts so deep.  
No comfort comes, no future breaks through,  
I am alone — a wound I cannot keep.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Inner Collapse</h2>
<p>
The light that enters feels completely false,  
My spirit sees no color in this room.  
The outside noise is just a fleeting waltz,  
A hollow tune that fills the growing gloom.  

My hands no longer reach, my body trapped,  
Each habit binds me tighter than a chain.  
Happiness no longer comes, all doors are snapped,  
The silence speaks in echoes of my pain.  

The mirror shows a face I do not know,  
An alien stranger staring back at me.  
Each passing moment steals what life should show,  
No dream finds refuge in my nightly sea.  

I discarded hope, awaiting no salvation,  
The tunnel ahead stretches deep and bare.  
No prayer or medicine can halt damnation,  
Only annihilation waits — my final stare.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Two-Line Verdict</h2>
<p>
The past is not a memory, it is sealed,  
A permanent mark no time can ever heal.  

My future waits for what I already feel,  
A silent pause where nothing can be real.  

The sun still rises, showing vibrant hue,  
Yet sight is blind to anything anew.  

I carry the burden of a life unclaimed,  
Each day repeats the same, unchanged, unnamed.  

Purpose now is simply to preserve  
Your absent name, the one I cannot serve.  

The door remains unlocked, a careless sign,  
The mind clings to a thought that once was mine.  

Everything I valued turns to naught,  
A life of lessons painfully taught.  

No hope arrives, no dawn brings release,  
Just waiting in the shadow of your absent peace.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>Forgotten Letters</h2>
<p>
I found our letters, torn and frayed,  
The ink of time had slowly decayed.  
Each page still hums with words of fire,  
Now cold with ash, consumed desire.  

You wrote of love, of dreams, of faith,  
Of stars we’d chase beyond the wraith.  
But pages burn when hearts grow numb,  
And silence shows what we’ve become.  

The words still smile, the lines still weep,  
The paper sighs — “some wounds run deep.”  
I tried to read, but couldn’t bear,  
The ghosts that lingered in the air.  

Our letters died, our story too,  
Yet every word still bleeds of you.  
I hold them close, though torn and worn,  
A fragile trace of what was sworn.  

Memories fade, yet ink remains,  
A testament to love and pains.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>On the Death of the Beloved</h2>
<p>
Though we weep your loss, you dwell within,  
A safe place in our hearts no storm can reach.  
Your love was dawn, brightening all our days,  
Awakening color beneath the dark’s cold sway.  

The sound of your voice brought new music,  
That brightened everything, a gentle light.  
Whatever your gaze touched, quickened joy,  
Smiles like flowers placed on the heart’s altar.  

Your mind sparkled, wonder in every thought,  
Though your days here were brief, your spirit full.  
We no longer look from the old distance,  
You dwell inside the rhythm of our breath.  

Though unseen by outward eyes, we see you still,  
Our soul’s gaze meets your face within all things.  
Let us not find you only in memory,  
But in presence, beauty, and kindness bright.  

Beside us when music echoes eternal tones,  
Your essence lives where love and light have grown.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>Half of Me</h2>
<p>
Since you’ve been gone, I’m not the same,  
A living soul without its name.  
Half of me breathes, the rest just waits,  
At sorrow’s door, at love’s old gates.  

The laughter fades, the colors blur,  
The world feels strange without you here.  
I walk through life, but not alive,  
I simply float, I don’t survive.  

Each smile I fake hides oceans deep,  
Of tears I promised not to weep.  
They see me whole, but they don’t see,  
That you took half, the best of me.  

And now I live with what remains true —  
A broken half that once belonged to you.  
The nights are long, the shadows speak,  
Of love once strong, now fragile and weak.  

I hold the fragments, though incomplete,  
A heart divided, yet still beats.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>Empty Pillow</h2>
<p>
Your side is cold, your scent has gone,  
Yet still I wait till early dawn.  
The pillow keeps your shape so real,  
Like love that time can never heal.  

I close my eyes and feel you near,  
Your whispers still ring in my ear.  
But when I reach — there’s only air,  
A cruel truth I cannot bear.  

The night goes on, the stars don’t care,  
They shine for all — you’re not there.  
The bed feels wide, the sheets too deep,  
Where dreams of you refuse to sleep.  

The pillow cries where you once lay,  
It knows you’re gone — it won’t decay.  
I trace the emptiness left behind,  
The silent echo of your mind.  

Each sigh I take, each tear I hide,  
Holds the shadow of you by my side.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Ghost in the Mirror</h2>
<p>
I saw your face inside the glass,  
A fleeting dream that came to pass.  
Your eyes looked tired, yet full of grace,  
Like time had failed to find its place.  

I reached to touch, the mirror cried,  
Your image broke — and so did I.  
My heart stood still, my breath turned slow,  
As shards of memory let me go.  

I see you now in every glare,  
In candlelight, in empty air.  
Each glimpse reminds me what I miss,  
The warmth, the pain, the final kiss.  

The ghost within that mirror’s hue,  
Is half of me — the half that’s you.  
I wander through the silent rooms,  
Haunted by love that only looms.  

Though gone, your shadow still remains,  
A silent echo of endless pains.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>You Forgot to Stay</h2>
<p>
You came like dawn, you left like dusk,  
A scent of rose turned into musk.  
You promised stars, you swore you’d stay,  
But dreams don’t last — they fade away.  

You left too soon, without goodbye,  
Without a tear to wet the sky.  
Now silence hums your favorite tune,  
Each night beneath the empty moon.  

You forgot to stay, but not to haunt,  
You visit dreams my soul can’t shun.  
I see your smile in passing light,  
It warms, it burns, it fades from sight.  

You forgot to stay — yet I remain,  
A slave to love, a friend to pain.  
The empty nights stretch on and on,  
While echoes of your laugh are gone.  

I hold the memory, sharp and true,  
Of every moment I had with you.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>For Grief</h2>
<p>
When you lose someone you love,  
Your life becomes strange,  
The ground beneath you becomes fragile,  
Your thoughts make your eyes unsure.  

Some dead echo drags your voice down  
Where words have no confidence.  
Your heart has grown heavy with loss;  
And though this loss has wounded others too,  
No one knows what has been taken from you  
When the silence of absence deepens.  

Flickers of guilt kindle regret  
For all that was left unsaid or undone.  

There are days when you wake up happy,  
Again inside the fullness of life,  
Until the moment breaks  
And you are thrown back  
Onto the black tide of loss.  

Days when you have your heart back,  
You are able to function well,  
Until in the middle of work or encounter,  
Suddenly with no warning,  
You are ambushed by grief.  

It becomes hard to trust yourself.  
All you can depend on now is that  
Sorrow will remain faithful to itself.  
More than you, it knows its way  
And will find the right time  
To pull and pull the rope of grief  
Until that coiled hill of tears  
Has reduced to its last drop.  

Gradually, you will learn acquaintance  
With the invisible form of your departed;  
And when the work of grief is done,  
The wound of loss will heal,  
And you will have learned  
To wean your eyes  
From that gap in the air  
And enter the hearth  
In your soul where your loved one  
Has awaited your return  
All the time.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>Before You Fade</h2>
<p>
Before you fade from all I know,  
Before the last soft candle’s glow —  
Let me remember how you spoke,  
Before our promises were broke.  

Let me recall the way you sighed,  
When truth was love, before it died.  
Your hands were warm, your heart was kind,  
Now all that’s left are thoughts confined.  

Before you vanish from my chest,  
Before I give your name to rest —  
Let me hold one memory true,  
Of who I was when I had you.  

Before you fade to mist and rain,  
Let love remain — despite the pain.  
Each heartbeat keeps your echo near,  
A silent witness of all I fear.  

Though shadows grow and time may part,  
Your memory lingers in my heart.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>When You Walked Away</h2>
<p>
You didn’t look back, not even once,  
Just walked away — my heart fell numb.  
The street grew long, the sky turned grey,  
As love dissolved and slipped away.  

Your steps grew faint, but echoes stayed,  
Inside the heart your absence made.  
I tried to call, but words were weak,  
They broke before they left my cheek.  

I stood there lost, like time had died,  
The world moved on — I stayed inside.  
You left without a single tear,  
Yet took the soul I kept so near.  

Now every dawn feels cold and strange,  
Since love walked off and never changed.  
The wind reminds me of your name,  
Each night repeats the same old flame.  

I reach for hope but find only air,  
A ghost of you is everywhere.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Shadow Beside Me</h2>
<p>
There’s a shadow that follows me still,  
Through lonely streets, through nights that kill.  
It moves like you, it breathes your name,  
A silent ghost that bears no shame.  

It never speaks, but I can hear,  
The echo of the love sincere.  
At times I wish to turn around,  
But nothing real is ever found.  

Your absence carved this shade from pain,  
And left me lost in endless rain.  
Now every light reminds of you,  
Every dark feels deeper too.  

The shadow stays, I can’t break free,  
It’s you — or what’s left haunting me.  
I try to speak, but sound won’t rise,  
My lips only whisper silent cries.  

Through every room, through every door,  
Your shade walks with me evermore.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Fires of Loss</h2>
<p>
Look, the trees are turning their own bodies into pillars of light,  
Giving off the rich fragrance of cinnamon and fulfillment bright.  

The long tapers of cattails float away over blue shoulders of the ponds,  
Each pond, no matter its name, is nameless now, responding to nature’s bonds.  

Every year, every lesson I have learned  
Leads back to this: the fires and the black river of loss, unearned.  

Its other side whispers salvation, hidden and unknown,  
A meaning that none of us will ever fully own.  

To live, you must love what is mortal, hold it against your bones,  
Knowing your own life depends on it, through sighs and moans.  

And when the time comes to let it go, let it go with grace,  
Release the ghost of presence, leave behind no trace.  

Yet still the river flows, the fire burns,  
Teaching the heart what each soul learns.  
Loss is the teacher, life is the test,  
We carry both inside our chest.  

To hold, to love, to finally release,  
This is the rhythm, the quiet, the peace.
</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<h2>The Nameless River</h2>
<p>
The wind moves gently through empty streets,  
Carrying whispers of what the heart still keeps.  

The river bends without a name,  
Flowing silently, yet never the same.  

I trace the water’s edge with trembling eyes,  
Seeing shadows of loss beneath the skies.  

The trees lean low, their branches weep,  
Secrets of sorrow they silently keep.  

Time stretches thin, a fragile thread,  
Binding the living with the absent dead.  

I reach for comfort that is never there,  
Finding only echoes, a hollow air.  

Yet still the river flows, indifferent, true,  
Reflecting the pain I cannot undo.  

To live is to learn, to grieve and release,  
To find, in absence, a fleeting peace.  

And when the sun sets beyond the hill,  
I hold my sorrow — silent, still.
